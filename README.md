<p align="center">Create pacmen to move in a certain area, bounce off any wall they hit and change direction<p>

## Description

The idea is to create as many pacmen as we want by pressing a button. Each pacman created has a random position and velocity in an specific area. By pressing another button "Start", we activate the movement of all the pacmen in the area. They will bounce off any wall they hit. From left to right or right to left the image of a pacman is reversed. Another button "Remove Pacman" is created to remove the last pacman added(last in first out).

## Roadmap

* Reduce the size of each pacman when it hit a wall, and automatically put it back to its normal size.
* Change direction when a pacman hits another one.
* Write a full description of the project in the man page.
